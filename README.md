# Let's Learn Effects!

Here you will find basic excercises to get started using effects. You'll learn:

1. Creating effects
2. Basic operations with effects
3. Basic handling of errors
4. Basic use of contexts

To start things off, run `yarn install`

You can run any of the scripts by using package scripts.
The following scripts are available:

```sh
yarn start:hello
yarn start:operators
yarn start:errors
yarn start:context
```

Each script will watch for changes in the file to run the file again (using nodemon). If you only want to run it once, use the `once:*` variants (i.e. `yarn once:hello`)

The ideal way to go about this workshop is by reading from top to bottom each file in order.
